## Game client that connects to the server!

This is a prototype game client that connects to my server.
Game is made using Monogame and C#.

This is also part of my Thesis project.

Note: Unfortunatly theres only a Windows release at this moment. I was unable to figure out a Mac support as I also don't own a mac my self.
- To play simply go to most recent release and download the .zip file.
- Extract the folder ProjectBGame and inside the win-x64 folder you will be able to run the Project_B_Client_App.exe

### Credits
Would like to quickly shoutout monogame extended for the map and player sprites. Although i animated the frames my self I'm still happy to give due credit for someone else's work!
