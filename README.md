## Game client that connects to the server!

This is a prototype game client that connects to my server.
Game is made using Monogame and C#.
Although the project has many flaws and issues this is my first time ever working with MonoGame and attempting to create an online experience. Was very fun and challenging. Very happy with the result non the less. :D

#### Some cool features:
- The fully self made tile map.
- Self made camera that follows the player and clamps to the maps borders
- Very well synced with the server, so you will see each other in real time.
- Animations (when moving around) synced well between clients
- A cool debugger/edittor feature that allowed me to map colliders

This is also part of my Thesis project.

Note: Unfortunatly theres only a Windows release at this moment. I was unable to figure out a Mac support as I also don't own a mac my self.
- To play simply go to most recent release and download the .zip file.
- Extract the folder ProjectBGame and inside the win-x64 folder you will be able to run the Project_B_Client_App.exe

### Credits
Would like to quickly shoutout monogame extended for the map and player sprites. Although i animated the frames my self I'm still happy to give due credit for someone else's work!
